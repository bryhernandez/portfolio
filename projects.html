            <h2>Macro Calculator 2.0</h2>
            <p>Using Xcode and SwiftUI, I developed and published an app that helps users calculate their daily caloric intake. After determining their calorie needs, users can customize their macronutrient ratios to suit their specific diet preferences, whether it’s keto, high-protein, or high-carb. The app offers a flexible and personalized approach to nutrition management, empowering users to optimize their diet according to their goals.
